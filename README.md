There is a live version of the site currently at bacaww.host (last updated 11/03/18)

In order to properly set up the website with the PHP databases on your personal machine
you must import the database via the file labeled "database.sql". If you make changes to the database, 
outside of data(I.E. new table or changed structure), please update the .sql file via the export function and rename it. 
Also you must add your own dbconnect.php file under /blog. It should the text that is in the readme.txt file (the code wouldn't go in the readme.md file)
except with your password. if this file(the dbconnect.php) gets updated at anytime, it should also be updated here
