There is a live version of the site currently at stuco.baccaw.host (last updated 11/18/18)

In order to properly set up the website with the PHP databases on your personal machine
you must import the database via the file labeled "database.sql". If you make changes to the database, 
outside of data(I.E. new table or changed structure), please update the .sql file via the export function and rename it. 
Also you must add your own dbconnect.php file in the main directory. It should contain the text that is in the readme.txt file (the code wouldn't go in the readme.md file)
except with your password instead of the blank I put in. if this file(the dbconnect.php) gets updated at anytime, it should also be updated here.

IMPORTANT!
because of a new datastructure update to the database, you must deleted the database you have been using, and create a new one named "stuco". Then go to import and select the database.sql file.

Don't move any files or change what files are used without asking the person using them (cough cough suggestions and post)
